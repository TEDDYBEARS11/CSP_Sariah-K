            <p> the imge of the swing is often times seen as a  beautiful painting. In which it is but it does have beautiful symbolism which is overlooked. The woman on the swing is seen wearing pink, why? Pink often symbolized feminity, grace, and softness. In which the woman is as told by her clothing, she has grace, she is a noble. The man behind her is her elderly husband, seen holding the rope, but a close look at the rope he is holding that is controlling the swing, or "the woman on the swing" is slowly breaking. Signifying that they relationship is breaking and that h is loosing his control over her. The husband is also in the dark, symbolizing how he does not know bout his wife's affair/secret lover. The man on the floor is her lover, at the time of this painting, Jean-Honoré Fragonard was asked to make this painting realistic, and at the time, showing ankles was a lot. he obviously added a little more to that. Anyways, moving on. Why is the lover on the floor? because their relationship is hidden and although her husband is in "the dark" the lover still needs to stay hidden. The man wears a pink flower on his clothing, why? Because it shoes the hidden secret between him and the woman. The sunlight is directly above the lover and the woman to siugnify that they are the only 2 who know what is truly happening. </p>

            <p>The Swing, oil painting created about 1767 by French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard. This is Fragonard's most celebrated painting, as well as one of the best-known images in 18th-century art. Baron Louis-Guillaume Baillet de Saint-Julien commissioned The Swing from Fragonard in order to depict him with his mistress. A version of the painting was sold at auction in 2013 for £17.1 million. The original painting is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and other major museums. A Renoir painting titled "The Swing" from 1876, which is also in the Musée d'Orsay, has a decorative resale value of $80-100. </p>
