            <p> the imge of the swing is often times seen as a  beautiful paintin. In which it is but it does have beautiful symbolism which is overlooked. The woman on the swing is seen wearing pink, why? Pink often symbolized feminity, grace, and softness. In which the woman is as told by her clothing, she has grace, she is a noble. The man behind her is her elderly husband, seen holding the rope, but a close look at the rope he is holding that is controlling the swing, or "the woman on the swing" is slowly breaking. The husband is also in the dark, symbolizing how he does not know bout his wife's affair/ secret loveer. The man on the floor is her lover, at the time of this painting, Jean-Honor√© Fragonard was asked to make this painting realistic, and at the time, showing ankles was a lot. he obviously added a little more to that. Anyways, moving on. Why is the lover on the floor? because their relationship is hidden and although her husband is in "thew dark" the lover still needs to stay hidden. The man wears a pink flower on his clothing, why? Because it shoes the hidden secret between him and the woman. The sunlight is directly above the lover and the woman to siugnify that they are the only 2 qho know what is truly happening. </p>
