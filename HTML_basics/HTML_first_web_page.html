        <h3> Intro to Lemons</h3>

        <p> Lemons are a versatile citrus fruit, prized for their tangy flavor and high vitamin C content. Many people may think that they are natural, and come from the Earth, or that they have been here forver; but in reality they are actually a cross-breeeding of citrons, which are a large tellow fruit, sometimes in the shape similar to a lemon but they consist of a thick rind. Lemons are also made out of bitter oranges. Bitter oranges are a type of citrus fruit with a sour, bitter taste, primarily used for making marmalade and other culinary applications, and also have uses in essential oils and traditional medicine. Don't get it wrong, lemons aren't man made but instead, they evolved over time. </p>
        
            <h3>How did we get the Lemons we have today?</h3>

Humans have cultivated lemons for hundred of years, evidence from as early as 200 BCE suggests that they were grown in Asia. Lemons had spread throughtout the world through the Mediterranian region through trade roues; with Arab traders playing a key role in the distribution of lemons. Lemons were later introduced to Europe by Arab traders and were cultivated in Genoa by the 15th century. Later in 1493 Christopher Columbus brought lemon seeds to the new world and planted them in Hispaniola. The modern citrus cause many to thing that genetically, lemons are thought to be a hybrid.
