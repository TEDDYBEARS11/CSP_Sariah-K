        <h3> WHAT ARE LEMONS?</h3>
        <p> Lemons are a versatile citrus fruit, prized for their tangy flavor and high vitamin C content. Many people may think that they are natural, and come from the Earth, or that they have been here forver; but in reality they are actually a cross-breeeding of citrons, which are a large tellow fruit, sometimes in the shape similar to a lemon but they consist of a thick rind. Lemons are also made out of bitter oranges. Bitter oranges are a type of citrus fruit with a sour, bitter taste, primarily used for making marmalade and other culinary applications, and also have uses in essential oils and traditional medicine. Don't get it wrong, lemons aren't man made but instead, they evolved over time. </p>
