Pink lemons were first discovered on an ordinary Eureka lemons tree in Burbank, California, in 1931. They were the result of a spontaneous mutation and are now grown commercially in Southern California. Also known as the “variegated pink lemon” or the “variegated Eureka lemon” due to its splotchy, colorful foliage!")
