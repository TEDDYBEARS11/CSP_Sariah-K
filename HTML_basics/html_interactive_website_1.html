        <p> Citrus refers to a group of flowering plants in the Rutaceae family that produce fruits known as citrus fruits. These fruits, like oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits, are characterized by a leathery rind and juicy, segmented flesh. The most commonly know citrus are Oranges, Lemons, and occasionally limes. In order to be considered a citrus it would need to be a flowering plant on a tree. There are many types of citrus oanges, reanging from manderin to even abnormally large oranges. Oranges provide vitamin C, fiber, potassium, phosphorus and B vitamins for the body. They also contain phytonutrients which can help fight disease. Oranges are one of the most commonly grown fruits in the world. </p>
