        <p> I think that CSP is better/funner because because we're not doing coding. Coding was really hard at first, but it started to get better to the end but I am so glad that we do not have to code anymore. I think that the easiest thing we had to learn was the stuff at the very begginging, because it was mostly just math. One thing that I really like about this unit is that we are ale to add pictures, so it makes it better, and that it is completely different from coding. I give coding a -5/10 and the networking unit a 10/10  </p>
